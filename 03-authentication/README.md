# What is Authentication

* The act of showing something to be true, genuine, or valid.

### In cybersecurity this usually means

Verifying the identity of a user or process

---

# Passwords

* Most common form of authentication
* "Something you know"
* Different ideas of strong versus weak passwords
* `12345`

# Password weaknesses

* People
* Weak passwords
* Phishing
* Shoulder surfing
* Leaks (raw or hashed!)
* Dictionaries
* Rainbow Tables
* Brute force
* Side channel attacks!!!
  * Password resets
  * Removal of MFA devices
  * Account recovery
* Bypass attacks
* People

---

# Password Attacks

Generally can be classified into two types:

* Online Password attacks
* Offline Password attacks

---

# Online Password Attacks

Attacks the login interface directly, frequently limited by speed (of network /
response from authenticator / input).

* Brute force
* Smarter brute force (dictionary / rainbow tables)
* Shoulder surfing (watching someone enter password)
* Pass the hash (application accepts hashes or passwords)
* Bypass (steal / access an already authenticated system)

# This slide is bad...  

But is a good example of an online password attack that does NOT require the internet.

# Offline Password Attacks

We will perform one of these in our next lab.

* Frequently much faster (attack speed can scale with attacker resources)
* Can be invisible to defenders (you dont know if/when your password is compromised)
* Many of the same attacks as online (brute force, dictionary, rainbow tables, etc.)
* Requires an offline source to attack 
  * File containing stolen password hashes
  * Phishing the user themselves
  * Key logging software that captures the password

---

# '/etc/shadow' Exercise

* Create a new user `sudo adduser tempuser`
* Give it a weak password (that you can share with other students)
  * No more than one use of the password: `password` per table please!!
* Print out that user's salted + hashed password
  * `sudo cat /etc/shadow | grep tempuser`
* Submit that entire output to Pilot (include the user name and all trailing `:::`
  * Reminder: plain text files only!!!
* I recommend deleting the created user as well:
  * `sudo userdel tempuser`

---

# Authentication defenses

* Password managers
* Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA / 2FA)
* Keys/tokens (PKI)
* Biometrics
* Policies and procedures

---

# Password Managers

* Allow for much stronger passwords
* Convenient for users
  * Until they are ***very*** inconvenient...
* Helps prevent easily guessable passwords
* Helps prevent re-used passwords

---

# Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)

* If passwords are so weak, then we will use another form of authentication alongside them.

* Hopefully a second form of authentication is chosen that is both secure and easy to remember.

* Processes introduced to deal with lost or forgotten MFA can provide attackers avenues of entry or data gathering.

---

# Key based authentication

* Public/Private Key pairs
  * User provides ***public key*** securely upon account setup
  * User authenticates with ***private key***
* Digital Certificates build upon key based authentication
  * Includes digital signature of a certification authority
  * Server verifies credibility of the certificate authority 

---

# Biometric authentication

Relies on unique biological characteristics of the user such as:

* fingerprints
* facial recognition
* speech recognition
* retinal scan
* etc.

---

# Token based authentication

User authenticates and receives a unique encrypted string to use for authentication against other related servers.  

Typically used with APIs with multiple frameworks and clients.


[auth types]: https://www.idrnd.ai/5-authentication-methods-that-can-prevent-the-next-breach/

---

# Policies and Procedures

* How the people and processes handle all parts of authentication
* How many password attempts?
* How long do you wait for MFA?
* How do you verify a user during account recovery?
* etc.

---

# Incident Response

You (will) get hacked. Then what?

---

# Mat Honan - A case study

* circa 2012
* Wired.com tech blogger
* twitter @mat
* Apple fanboy (joking, but does use apple products)
  * `m******@me.com`
* Enjoys amazon.com delivery of goods to his home address

---

# What happened

* August 2012
* 5pm iphone resets
* phone power on and iphone is at setup screen
  * (backups etc were done nightly so no fear yet)
* plug phone in to laptop to restore/recover
  * notification on macbook of incorrect credentials
  * macbook has new (unknown) 4 digit pin protection

***What would you do?***

---

# What actually happened (all times are approximate)

* Aug 2012
* 4pm buys a toothbrush amazon.com
* 4:30pm amazon account reset with unknown credit card and Mat Honan's address
* 4:45pm me.com reset with last 4 of Mat Honan's CC and address
* 4:47pm gmail.com reset with me.com
* 4:50pm twitter.com reset with gmail.com
* 4:55pm me.com and gmail.com accounts ***permanently deleted*** with all data
* 5pm hacker brags on their newly acquired @mat handle of their hack 

---

# The hack

These are the steps the attacker went through:

* First all, the reason behind it, they (attacker) wanted @mat Twitter handle
  * Yes I chose not to update this slide to the new name of X, they are all still tweets in my mind...
  * backround research revealed @mat is Matthew Honan
  * find physical address from various online lookups
  * find email address from various online lookups

* try to sign into twitter with that gmail address 
  * this confirmed that the gmail address is @mat

* try to sign into that gmail address
  * ***no 2fa !!!  :( !!! :(  !!!***
  * account recovery is `m******@me.com`


---

# The hackening continued

* me.com allows for account recovery with two simple things
  * last 4 of your credit card
  * billing address

* try to sign in with various Mat Honan emails
  * finds the one that works
  * crafts a purchase for a toothbrush ***using the hacker's credit card***
